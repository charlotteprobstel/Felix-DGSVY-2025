Addiction
To forget / be detached from the horrible circumstances I am in and my past rather than cope with it healthily 
To drown my sorrows 
To pull
To get out of my head for a bit
quench thirst
For the mood
Iâ€™m an alcoholic 
To bare social interaction 
Fun with friends
Because my family do
Because I want to
